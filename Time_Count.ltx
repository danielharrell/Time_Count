\maketitle

If you asked me the question ``What is the time?'' I could
look at my watch---or these days, at my phone---and tell
you. It's [current time=A]. But what if you changed
your question, by leaving out the definite article? Suppose
your question weren't ``What is \emph{the} time?'', but more
simply, ``What is~\dots\ time?''   

In that case, it's hard to know what my answer would be, but
easy to suppose that it could not be as immediate, or exact,
or conclusive as the time [A] was to your
first question.  And about a matter less suited to our
phones than to some theory, even philosophy, about the
nature of time.

There is no shortage of such philosophies. The Freshmen, in
fact, have just finished reading one---Aristotle's---while
the Sophomores read another---Augustine's---last semester. I
myself will be referring to Aristotle's at least twice in my
lecture tonight; but I will do so at least twice, then, with
a caveat. The caveat has to do with the question that will
guide me in this lecture, which is not, for better or worse,
the question: ``What is time?''---at least if asking this
question means turning away, either at once or for good,
from our time-telling clocks, or watches, or phones, as if
our telling of time had nothing to tell us, to teach us,
about the nature of time.  My question, then, is something
less like ``What is time?'' and something more like: ``What
is it about time that allows it to be told?'' What is it
about time that allows us to ask about \emph{the}
time---definite article reintroduced---and to answer that
question with all the immediacy, the exactness, and the
conclusiveness of ``it's [time A]''---or rather,
``[current time=B].'' My working hypothesis for the next hour,
then, will be that in telling you it's [time B], or
indeed in referring to ``the next hour'' as I just did, and
more generally in every ready-at-hand way we have of marking
time, of measuring time, of reckoning time, there is
something important to discover, even essential, about the
nature of time.  Something that accounts for time, in our
counting of time. 

But what could this be? After all, there is nothing
essential in my calling the next hour ``an hour.'' For I
could just as well have called this hour ``60 minutes.'' Or
even ``3,600 seconds''---if I've done my math right; and
despite the fact that the number 3,600 is not the number 60,
nor is 60 the number one---if there is such a number. Our
counting of time in this sense, the sense in which we use
numbers to mark \emph{intervals} of time, seems conventional and
arbitrary, rather rather than rooted or essential. 

There seems to be even more convention and arbitrariness in
the counting of time that led me to say it was [time A], or
[time B], or, now, [current time=C].  This is the count
where we use numbers to mark \emph{moments} of time rather
than intervals.  For while it may be [time C] in Annapolis,
it is only [time C minus two hours=D] in Santa Fe. I
could also call it [time D] in Flagstaff---if I were giving
this lecture before Spring Break. But in giving it tonight,
I will have to admit that it is only [time D minus one
hour=E] in Flagstaff, since Flagstaff, like the rest of
Arizona, doesn't observe Daylight Saving Time. And if I were
giving this lecture before the Uniform Time Act of 1966, I
wouldn't know what to say about the time elsewhere. For back
then, cities in the United States could choose their own
dates for Daylight Saving Time at will; and they did, in
what Time Magazine called a ``chaos of clocks.'' Not the
clocks we find populating Einstein's theory of
relativity, as if cities had discovered themselves in
different frames of reference with no present moment in
common; but rather the clocks we more innocently use in
everyday life, where there is taken to be a present moment
in common, but no like moment in number, it seems, no number
that belongs to ``now,'' to stop us from assigning it
different numbers at once---where ``now'' is [current
time=F] in Annapolis, [time F minus one hour] in Memphis,
[time F minus two hours] in Santa Fe, or [time F minus three
hours] in Flagstaff.

Even a further description of ``now'' gives us no sense of
the number that might belong to it. The ``now'' that begins
Friday Night lecture in Annapolis, for example, is
officially 8:00, but it used to be 8:15. In Santa Fe it is
7:30, but used to be 8:00. Similarly with the ``now'' that
begins seminar: for undergraduates in Annapolis, this is 8,
but for graduate institute students 7:30---and 7:30 in Santa
Fe for both.  ---Except for the 4:30 seminars, one for each
class, the year I was in Santa Fe. And if we include
seminar-parties, where the start-time is assigned at will,
well---there would seem no time excluded in principle: which
is again as if to say there is no ``now'' in number; that
is, no number that belongs intrinsically to any present
moment. And in that case there may be no number that belongs
intrinsically to time, if time itself exists only ``now,'' in the
present moment, since the past is no longer and the future
not yet. 

But then we might have inferred that much---that time is one
thing and number something else---even without examples from
convention.  For if we think of time as having any
properties beyond the present moment, it is most likely when
we think of this moment as ever-changing---which is to say,
when we think of time as if it were like a stream, or flow:
continuous and ongoing. But the numbers we use to count time
are discrete, and in the most common cases recurring, going
repeatedly back to 1 from day to day, week to week, month to
month, and year to year, even as time itself marches on---a
fact soon enough written into our faces, even if we erase it
from our clocks and calendars.  But this is not just another
sign of something conventional rather than essential in our
counting of time; it also suggests that our count in these
cases is really of motion, which is to say, of a change in
place rather than time. We count to 365, in this sense, in
following the yearly trip of the earth around the sun; just
as we count to 30, in following the monthly trip of the moon
around the earth; and to 24, in following the daily trip of
the earth around itself. And dividing this 24 into its
units, accordingly divides the earth into 24 places---each a
so-called time zone---accounting for the difference in time
between Annapolis and Santa Fe, as really a
difference in place. Even our weekly count to 7 in this
sense, which otherwise has no source in the completed motion
of any celestial body, might still be said to follow a
motion---the very motion that, on one account at least,
created every celestial body, along with everything else, over six
days of work finished by a seventh day of rest. 

If our counting of time is really of place, this would
explain not simply the recurrence in our count, but the
discreteness in number that makes it a count. And our
clocks, so understood, would be no different from our rulers:
dividing a continuous magnitude into so many successive but
contiguous parts, in a count from, say, 1 to 12. The count
will be of inches if we find this magnitude laid out on a
ruler; but if we rather find it rounded off, as on the face
of watch, the count will be of hours. In both cases,
however, the count from 1 to 12 will be following a change
in place, not time. 

But this much comparison between clocks and rulers obscures
an essential difference. For the count from 1 to 12 on a
ruler takes place at once (perhaps put taking time up here
immediately, mention circularity, but then try to analyze it
out of the account to make sense of time) mention
simultaneity here).  And this is why, when we use a ruler to
count, we reach any number---say, 6 inches---by inspection
rather than calculation. since its parts, or places, exist
alongside one another, in a relation of simultaneity. And in
, the count from 1 to 12 on a watch---well, it takes time,
or at least takes place in a kind of succession that invites
us to re-consider the nature of this count.  the count is a
counting of. In a sense, we ourselves cannot count to 12 on
a watch, just like that; we have to wait for the hour-hand
to do it, as it inches its way round the circumference. The
waiting is less if we follow the minute-hand around the
circumference, and still less for the second-hand, but this
only underlines the point. In every such case, and it seems
to make for the difference between a temporal count and a
merely spatial count, the count in question follows the
change in place not directly, but through a motion. The
count itself is not what carries us from place to place, but  

And this reflects a difference
in what we mean by \emph{counting} in either case. For in
the case of the ruler, we can redivide the magnitude into,
say, sixty parts, and our count to 60 will be equal to our
count to 12, by encompassing the same interval of length.
But on a watch-face, this same redivision of its
circumference, from 12 parts into 60, makes for unequal
counts, since they encompass different intervals of time. In
the case of a ruler, our count from 1 to 12 can be remade ,
we could say that while the count from 1 to 12 on a ruler
[Distinguish second, minute, hour hand, and 12 from 60;
different rates of speed.] Note too that the divisions of
the same magnitude also take different times. Also how this
underlines the sense in which we are indeed counting a time.
We have to wait for the .  Link to count in sense that the
different times each have a different count. 

it will be a
magnitude that we measure And this would be by analogy to the
way we measure any magnitude, which may be continuous in
itself but is divided into parts And just as the recurrence
of our countThis not only explains recurrence of our count,
but the discreteness of the numbers we use in the count.
Start this paragraph by now talking about how the the
continuity of time is in truth a continuity in the places of
the motion, and our use of numbers here is no different than
our use of them is measuring places with a ruler. [Put how
this is exactly like the measure of a ruler]

Mention how the count itself can be regarded as a motion,
and use Einstein, along with the sense in which larger
time-scales depend on the clock time-scale of each passing
hour, to support this. 
But then use the Aristotle to counter that. This part will
then conclude with the observation that we have altogether
separating our count of time from time. How to restore them?
Then go on to use the Aristotle.


Brief show how change explains everything about the previous
examples. Even to the point of thinking that the count tself
is a kind of change (refer to Einstein), leaving nothing to
time.  Then use Aristotle as transition.  but even that it
isn't of time that we do it.
