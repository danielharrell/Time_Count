\title{Making Time Count}

\begin{document}
\maketitle

If you asked me the question ``What is the time?'' I could
look at my watch---or these days, at my phone---and tell
you. It's [current time=A]. But what if you changed
your question, by leaving out the definite article? Suppose
your question weren't ``What is \emph{the} time?'', but more
simply, ``What is~\dots\ time?''   

In that case, it's hard to know what my answer would be, but
easy to suppose that it could not be as immediate, or exact,
or conclusive as the time [A] was to your
first question.  And about a matter less suited to our
phones than to some theory, even philosophy, about the
nature of time.

The Freshmen, in fact, have just finished reading
one---Aristotle's; and my debts to it in this lecture should
be clear before I'm done. But so will my debts to Euclid.
And the question that guides me tonight will not be ``What is
time?''---at least if asking this question means turning
away, either at once or for good, from our phones, our
watches, our clocks; or more generally, from the numbers we use
to tell time, and as if our telling of time had
nothing to tell us---to teach us---about the nature of time.
My question, then, is something less like ``What is time?'',
and something more like: ``What is it about time that allows
it to be told?'' What is it about time that allows us to ask
about the time---definite article reintroduced---and to
answer that question with all the immediacy, the exactness,
and the conclusiveness of ``it's [time
A]''---or rather, ``[current time=B].'' My hypothesis for
the next hour, then, will be that in telling you it's [time
B], or indeed in referring to ``the next hour,'' and more
generally in every ready-at-hand way we have through numbers
of marking time, measuring time, reckoning time, there
is something important to discover, even essential, about
the nature of time.  Something that accounts for time, in
our counting of time.

But what could this be? After all, there is nothing
essential in my calling the next hour ``an hour.'' For I
could just as well have called this hour ``60 minutes.'' Or
even ``3,600 seconds''---if I've done my math right; and
despite the fact that the number 3,600 is not the number 60,
nor is 60 the number 1---if there is such a number. Our
counting of time in this sense, the sense in which we use
numbers to mark \emph{intervals} of time, seems borrowed and
arbitrary rather than rooted or necessary---a matter of
convention rather than essence. 

And there is even more convention, it would
seem, in the counting of time that led me to say it was
[time A], or [time B], or, right now, [current time=C].  This is
the count where we use numbers to mark \emph{moments} of
time rather than intervals.  For while it may be [time C] in
Annapolis on this side of King George Street, it is [time C
+ 12] on the other side---and only [time C minus two
hours=D] in Santa Fe. I could also call it [time D] in
Flagstaff---if I were giving this lecture before Spring
Break. But in giving it tonight, I will have to admit that
it is only [time D minus one hour=E] in Flagstaff, since
Arizona refuses to observe Daylight Saving Time. And if I were
giving this lecture before the Uniform Time Act of 1966, I
wouldn't know what to say about the time elsewhere. For back
then, cities in the United States could choose their own
dates for Daylight Saving Time at will; and they did, in
what Time Magazine called a ``chaos of clocks.'' And not the
clocks we find populating Einstein's theory of relativity,
as if cities had discovered themselves in different frames
of reference with no present moment in common; but rather
the clocks we more innocently use in everyday life, where
there is taken to be a present moment in common, but no like
moment in number, it seems, no number that belongs to
``now,'' to stop us from assigning it different numbers at
once---where ``now'' is [current time=F] in Annapolis, [time
F minus one hour] in Memphis, [time F minus two hours] in
Santa Fe, or [time F minus three hours] in Flagstaff.

And giving content to this present moment, still gives us no sense
of the number that might belong to it. The ``now'' that
begins Friday Night lecture in Annapolis, for example, is
officially 8:00pm, but it used to be 8:15. In Santa Fe it is
7:30, but used to be 8:00. Similarly with the ``now'' that
begins seminar: for undergraduates in Annapolis, this is 8,
but for graduate institute students 7:30---and 7:30 in Santa
Fe for both.  ---Except for the 4:30 seminars, one for each
class, at least the year I was in Santa Fe. And if we
include seminar-parties, where the start-time is assigned at
will, well---there would seem no number excluded in principle:
which is again as if to say there is no ``now'' in number;
no number that belongs intrinsically to any present
moment.  And if time itself exists only in the present
moment, since the past is no longer and the
future not yet, then there would seem to be no number that
belongs intrinsically to time. 

But then we might have inferred this much---that time is one
thing and number something else---even without such
examples. 
% Dedekind, whom the Juniors are about to read, once
% called numbers ``free creations of the human mind.'' If only
% this were true as well about the moments of time.
For if we think of time as having any existence
beyond the present moment, it is most likely when we think
of this moment as ever-new, making time 
like a river, flowing ever onward.   
% Later say time is like a march, not river.
But our counting of time uses number to form a different kind
of succession, which is never continuous and
usually recurring: going repeatedly back to 1
from day to day, week to week, month to month, and year to
year, even as time itself rolls on---a fact soon enough
written on our faces, even if we erase it from our clocks
and calendars. 

% Perhaps later link the discreteness to the possibility of
% recurrence But there would be no way to go back to 1,
% unless our numbers were at-hand in a way that time is
% evidently not; and counting from one moment to the next,
% even as the earlier moment vanishes, didn't cause the
% earlier number to vanish.  

Our counting of time in these respects even suggests that
the count is not really of time, but rather of place, in
following motions that, unlike time, continue and finally
complete themselves with respect to place. We count to 365,
then, in following the yearly trip of the earth around the
sun; as we count to 30---or close enough---in following the
monthly trip of the moon around the earth; or to 24, in
following the daily trip of the earth around itself. And
dividing this 24 into its units, accordingly divides the
earth into 24 places---each a so-called time zone,
explaining the difference in time between Annapolis and
Santa Fe as really a difference in place.  Even our weekly
count to 7 in this sense, which otherwise has no source in
the completed motion of any celestial body, might still be
said to follow one---the very motion that, on one account at
least, created every celestial body, along with everything
else, over six days of work finished by a seventh of rest.
Nor need we look so far above us for seeming proof that our
telling of time is really of place. For we can find this
proof writ small on the face of any watch, where every
number has its place, and every time in turn, its position.
Yet if time itself has no place or position---and we might
even consider it a negation of any place or position---then
our every clock, it seems, tells a bald-faced lie.

But this is to argue against what I earlier called my
hypothesis for the next hour---now my hypothesis for the
next [9:00 - current time] minutes---which is that our every clock tells the
truth. And perhaps it is time---whatever that may be---to
make the case for clocks. Consider again our sense of time
itself, when we think of it like a river. In certain
respects---decisive respects, I think---the simile falls
short. For the motion of a river, we can see and say, is
made by the river, as it moves along its banks, now more
swiftly, now more slowly.  But in the motion of time, there
is nothing like the river or its banks to see, nothing
visibly moving relative to anything else. And no surprise,
for there would only be anything visible, it seems, if the
motion of time were a motion in space.  This motion is
already peculiar, then, in belonging to time and time alone.
And it becomes still more peculiar when we consider its
progress.  We sometimes fancy that, again like a river
moving swifter or slower, time itself can fly or drag. But
if time could really do this, how would we know?  When
anything else changes its speed, after all, we can use some
unit of time to confirm it, as a change in the distance
traveled, for example, per minute.  But we are deprived of
this unit to confirm any change of speed in time itself; for
the unit is now in question: is this minute, when compared
to the last, or the next, faster or slower, longer or
shorter?  But even before this question we must ask another,
since to say that time can change its speed assumes that
time has a speed. But what could we mean by time's speed? In
what sense could time itself travel any distance, if we are
then deprived of any measure in space to account for it? And
how long would it take time to travel this distance, if we
are then deprived of any measure in time to account for it? 

% Next paragraph should lead to conclusion that if we are
% strip any taint of space from our conception of time in
% all its progressiveness, it becomes hard not to conceive
% it as a succession of numbers, as a count. 

It begins to look as if our attributing any motion to time
involves a category mistake, claiming for time itself, and
apart from space, what can only happen \emph{in} time and
space together. And this correction suggests that time
itself is not a motion, but rather a medium for motion---a
qualification implicit in our sense that when something
moves from place to place, it does so \emph{in}, or even
\emph{through}, some corresponding length of time. But to
admit even this much risks another conflation of time and
space; for what could we mean by a ``length'' of time?
Indeed, the only conception of time so far that promises to
escape any such conflation with space, is one that reduces
the length of time to ``now,'' the present moment,
since the present moment can be conceived to have
no length. It makes sense to think that this
moment lasts only, well, a moment, or instant, before a new
such moment takes its place, so to speak.  Or, to borrow an
earlier formulation, it makes sense to think of the present
moment as ever-new. But this is also what tempts us to
compare time to a river. And if that analogy is false in
being spatial, then what is time really like in being
temporal?

% Give two reasons: size in itself and then in motion,
% reverting back to river briefly, but then raising a
% question about the best analogy. Turns out to be the unit,
% and counting. Make point emphatic at end of that paragraph
% that the only analogy that doesn't revert to space is
% number. Then in next paragraph transition with: our

% sense of what time is than what number is. Use the unit as
% our first example of this, that this belongs to "now"
% rather than any number. Then use the integrity of numbers
% by addition, then move on from there.

It is just here, I think, that our counting of time deserves
some credit. For let us suppose the present moment indeed
has no length. If it has no length, then it is no larger, we
could say, than a geometric point.  But saying this risks
another spatial analogy. For even though the point has no
part according to Euclid's definition, its integrity in this
sense, being spatial, makes the point a position, or
location. The point is where a line begins and ends, for
example; or where any two lines intersect. But the integrity
of the present moment, being temporal, is opposed to this;
and we might even characterize it as if it negated the
integrity of the point, by saying that the present moment
can occupy \emph{every} location in space, not just the one
location occupied by a point. But saying this still relies
on an appeal to space---all of space in fact. So what should
we say instead? A more promising characterization, I think,
is one I just mentioned a moment ago: namely, that the present
moment is ever-new. For as soon as the present moment
begins, it ends, in having no parts; and as soon as it ends,
it is replaced, in having no position. This is why the
integrity of the present moment is temporal rather than
spatial; for in having neither part nor position, this
moment defines time as a dimension of succession rather than
simultaneity. But this gives us a way to distinguish the
present moment from the geometric point absolutely. For if
the present moment is indeed ever-new in lacking parts and
position, then one such moment will be replaced by the next
immediately, without any space between the two. The lack of
space in this sense would be another mark of the moment's
temporal integrity. But this---space---is precisely what
remains as a mark of spatial integrity, as the position
without parts possessed by the point, allows it to occupy
space without consuming it.  Thus, there is no way to
encounter points in succession, from one to the next;
between any two, no matter how close, there will be space
enough for a third. But the present moment, then, is not only
\emph{not} a point, it is not even \emph{like} a point.  And
if we have any hope of finding something that the present
moment is truly like, it will have to be what has neither
parts nor position.

But what has neither parts nor position, as it happens, is
one way to define the unit, out of which every number is
made. The unit, that is, according to classical arithmetic.
I call it ``classical,'' since we are tempted, by later
developments in the theory of number, to think of the unit
itself as a number. And if we do, then it is easy to suppose
that the unit has both parts and position, being the first
of the so-called counting numbers, which we can always
divide by a larger such number to yield some fraction of
itself.  But it is precisely those suppositions that the
classical understanding of number calls into question. And
it is the unit on \emph{that} understanding, so I now
propose, that not only makes most sense of how we count when
counting time; but is also what time is most like when we
erase any hint of space from our sense of it.  It will turn
out that we are all Euclideans when we tell the time---and
that time itself is Euclidean most of all.  

To begin to see this, But so what? Well, for one thing, to
talk of the ``space'' between numbers being ``filled'' by
the unit risks(Mention problem with space
here, then clarify by example showing that we think of unit
as having position, arranging numbers on a number line.)
Well, to see what, consider the count from 8 to 9, which
numbers correspond, more or less, to the time of the lecture
I'm giving right now, from 8:00 to 9:00, taking the unit of
the count in that case to be the hour.  On my proposal, this
unit should be understood as having no parts; therefore, it
cannot be divided. But surely it \emph{can} be divided.
Otherwise, what could it mean to say, quite intelligibly,
that I have been at this podium already for roughly [current
time-8:00 minutes] of this hour? Or that I will be standing
here for roughly [9:00-current time minutes] more? Or to
look at my phone and declare that it is exactly [current
time]? In all these cases, I seem to be dividing the unit
that allows me to count by hour from 8 to 9. And that the
unit in this case is obviously, almost self-evidently
divisible, is what causes us to think, as I noted at the
beginning of my lecture, that there is nothing essential in
my calling the next hour an hour. For I could just as well
have called it 60 minutes, or even 3,600 seconds.  

But there is something to notice in all this division that
is easy to overlook. For when we divide the unit like this
meaningfully, it is to give the hour not simply parts, but
position. I think of the next hour as
having parts like this, I am also giving it a position,
which is why I can call it the ``next'' hour. Similarly with
the present hour, when I think of it as \emph{this} hour, to
distinguish it from the last or next.  And our division of
the hour is most often done to establish this position more
precisely.  (Speak of where I am in the current lecture.) So
when we give the unit parts, we are also giving it position.
cyySimilarly when I think of the present hour as having
parts--Or if I think of the present hour as having partsor
the present hour as h like this, there is next hour ahead of
me that I can divide into minutes or seconds, or when I
think there is a present hour as divisible into minutes or
seconds, or when I think I am right now at some particular
place in the current hour, I now want to suggest that our
intuitions about this are wrong. was I actually correct in
saying this? In one sense, I think I was. And this is the
sense in which we can indeed refer to the next hour as if
the hour had position, and divide this hour into seconds as
if the hour had parts.  Or more generally, I was correct in
the sense that we can indeed attribute both position and
parts to the unit by which we tell time. But when we give
the unit parts and position like this, I want to suggest, we
are no longer using the unit to count; we are rather using
the unit to measure. In other words, this is the unit that
makes the numbers we read off a ruler rather than a clock.

% So in another sense I was incorrect saying I could just as
% well call the next hour the next 60 minutes. 

(Now go on to write about how the unit has integrity like
temporal integrity in counting; while the unit has spatial
integrity in measuring. Like we conflate space and time, we
conflate rulers with clocks, and the way we use numbers on
both. Go into this difference, with the purpose being to
show how the unit is divisible as a matter of measurement,
but not as a matter of counting. Compare ruler-face with
watch-face. For example, while 60 minutes might be equal to
3600 seconds, involving a unit subdivided (1 minute=60
seconds), once we speak of these numbers temporally, in
terms of a count, then we are counting from 1 to 60 to get
to the minute. the unit remains whole in the count. Then go
back to abstract discussion, show that if we treat the unit
spatially, then we don't correct for the difference between
points and present moments; there seem to be units in
"locations" in each number, and a gap between any two
counting numbers that can be filled in. But if we take
numbers to be generated in counting, there there is only one
unit,  "now", which is then added to get any number, and
fills the gap. Also point out that saying "one" defines the
unit by which numbers are subsequently counted. This can
vary. Of no particular size.  One implication of the unit so
understood can be formulated now.  For if the present moment
were most like the unit in this sense, then we could still
grant that no number belongs to this moment intrinsically,
but only because what belongs to it intrinsically is the
unit that composes every such number.  But a second
implication is readily inferred in the contrast between what
the point cannot do and what the unit can.  For points, so
we observed, have nothing by which they might be put
together, to form a line of any length. But this is
inevitably what units do when they are joined  


% Contrast unit put together with unit, and point put
% together with point. Perhaps even talk about discreteness
% and recurrence.

% Then move on in next
% paragraph to how to really read a watch. Perhaps then move
% on to poetry and music.)
But there is a
paradox here, which suggests that time can only move forward
if it is \emph{not} like a flow. For it is not as if going
forward in time gives time any length it lacked in the
present moment, since it takes length to produce length. But
is nothing in this moment that can join it to any other such
moment, the way that two lengths can be joined on one side
at a point.  This lack of length wouldn't preclude the
present moment from being ever-new; it would only preclude
the result of its being ever-new from having continuity. Or
to put the result more positively: if the present moment
were ever-new, but lacked any length, then this would
produce a succession of such moments.
% Later deepen this conception through the distinction
% between a succession or sequence, and a series.
But this succession would carry us forward not like the flow
of a river, but rather like the count to a number, in which
the unit is also, in a sense, ever-new---as it repeatedly,
or ever-newly, carries us from 1 to 2, then from 2 to 3,
then from 3 to 4, and so on. 

[This should be a new paragraph.] What is more, because we are
now counting our way from number to number, the difference
between numbers that make its domain discrete rather than
continuous is in one sense overcome. 3 is separated from 2
by a unit, to be sure; but it is by this same unit that we
get from  2 to 3 in a count. Or to put the point a different
way, while 3 may be composed of three separate units as a
number, it is composed of three units added together as a
sum. And it suggests, if we now take counting to be what
time is most like in going forward, that what we initially
take to be the continuity in this going-forward is really an
integrity. 

this
adding-together that leads to any number in a count, would
seem to give sufficient integrity to the succession 


to be sure; but it is this very unit thwhile this succession
of numbers is no doubt discontinuous, the result of
this count is discontinous If time's likeness to counting seems
implausible so described, Moreover, it would only be true in one
sense that this count was discontinuous: 

Continuity vs integrity. 

Now move on to difference between counting and measuring.

the present moment to what has neither position nor part. rid the analogy of any position, making the
present moment like what has neither position nor part. But
the only thing like this is unit.

of time's like motion, Consider again First, there is
something amiss paradoxical and even incoherent in our sense
of time itself. We might again suppose it flows like a
stream, or river, but presumably without any change of
actual place or ; yet time is surely unlike a stream or
river in more decisive respects: for this is presumably
without any change in place, If we think of it as a stream,
or flow, we are thinking of it by analogy to a river; but
the analogy, when pressed, falls apart almost at once. For
one thing, the flow of a river is a motion, involving both a
change of place and a thing doing the changing. ---let us
suppose these belong to the bank, andes a change of place
along with an identifiable sourceis a motion that involves a
discernible change of place; whereas the flow of

working hypothesis

And if our counting of time were really of place, it would
explain not simply the recurrence in our count, but the
discreteness in number that makes it a count. For then we
could say that each such number corresponds to a place in
the motion counted. And our clocks, so understood, would be
no different from our rulers: dividing a continuous
magnitude into so many successive but contiguous parts, in a
count from, say, 1 to 12. The count will be of inches if we
find this magnitude laid out on a ruler; but if we rather
find it rounded off, as on the face of watch, then the count
will be of hours. In both cases, however, the count from 1
to 12 will be following a change in place, not time.
The only difference, it seems, will
be one that underlines the sense in which our apparent
counting of time is really of place.  For the count from 1
to 12 on a ruler can take place at once, while the count
from 1 to 12 on a watch---well, we might have said it takes
time, but according to the account just given, we should
rather say it takes motion: in this case, the motion of an
hour-hand, inching its way around the watch's circumference,
which in turn follows the motion of the earth around its own
circumference. And so it goes if we count instead to 60 on
our watch, now following the faster motion of a minute-hand
or still-faster motion of a second-hand. All these cases
suggest that a change in place is not simply what our
apparent counting of time is really of, but even what it
really is if temporal at all: involving one motion, like the
rotation of the earth, being counted by another motion, like
the hour-hand of a watch. Perhaps time itself is yet a third
motion, encompassing the first two and any other; but it is
hard to see how this motion is Similarly,  Just our count
from 1 to 60 on a watch the count from 1 to  we can  

But this much comparison between clocks and rulers obscures
an essential difference. For the count from 1 to 12 on a
ruler takes place at once (perhaps put taking time up here
immediately, mention circularity, but then try to analyze it
out of the account to make sense of time) mention
simultaneity here).  And this is why, when we use a ruler to
count, we reach any number---say, 6 inches---by inspection
rather than calculation. since its parts, or places, exist
alongside one another, in a relation of simultaneity. And in
, the count from 1 to 12 on a watch---well, it takes time,
or at least takes place in a kind of succession that invites
us to re-consider the nature of this count.  the count is a
counting of. In a sense, we ourselves cannot count to 12 on
a watch, just like that; we have to wait for the hour-hand
to do it, as it inches its way round the circumference. The
waiting is less if we follow the minute-hand around the
circumference, and still less for the second-hand, but this
only underlines the point. In every such case, and it seems
to make for the difference between a temporal count and a
merely spatial count, the count in question follows the
change in place not directly, but through a motion. The
count itself is not what carries us from place to place, but  

Also mention that on a ruler, the places themselves are
numbered, while on a watch, it is only a motion through
those places that is numbered.
And this reflects a difference
in what we mean by \emph{counting} in either case. For in
the case of the ruler, we can redivide the magnitude into,
say, sixty parts, and our count to 60 will be equal to our
count to 12, by encompassing the same interval of length.
But on a watch-face, this same redivision of its
circumference, from 12 parts into 60, makes for unequal
counts, since they encompass different intervals of time. In
the case of a ruler, our count from 1 to 12 can be remade ,
we could say that while the count from 1 to 12 on a ruler
[Distinguish second, minute, hour hand, and 12 from 60;
different rates of speed.] Note too that the divisions of
the same magnitude also take different times. Also how this
underlines the sense in which we are indeed counting a time.
We have to wait for the .  Link to count in sense that the
different times each have a different count. 

it will be a
magnitude that we measure And this would be by analogy to the
way we measure any magnitude, which may be continuous in
itself but is divided into parts And just as the recurrence
of our countThis not only explains recurrence of our count,
but the discreteness of the numbers we use in the count.
Start this paragraph by now talking about how the the
continuity of time is in truth a continuity in the places of
the motion, and our use of numbers here is no different than
our use of them is measuring places with a ruler. [Put how
this is exactly like the measure of a ruler]

Mention how the count itself can be regarded as a motion,
and use Einstein, along with the sense in which larger
time-scales depend on the clock time-scale of each passing
hour, to support this. 
But then use the Aristotle to counter that. This part will
then conclude with the observation that we have altogether
separating our count of time from time. How to restore them?
Then go on to use the Aristotle.


Brief show how change explains everything about the previous
examples. Even to the point of thinking that the count tself
is a kind of change (refer to Einstein), leaving nothing to
time.  Then use Aristotle as transition.  but even that it

even say that philosophical reflection. Mention Augustine
and Aristotle, along with ignorance and non-existence, about
the nature of time. As if time were something mysterious and
deep. Then proceed to a lecture keeping closer
to the connection, since there seems to be one. And that
reflection can start where we are. [Now move on to why the
separation.] 


Why in that case is there a seeming distance—even
gap—between the ease of answering the question "what is the
time?" and the difficulty of answering the question "what is
timee?"

% Unobvious implications: present moment is relative, while
% the counting of time is absolute (thus, the now in Santa
% fe is different from the now here, by the count of the
% time, not according to relativity; it is indeed earlier
% there than here. We have already experienced the now they
% have experienced. Not simply according to the sun, but
% according to time.) Also, time is not continuous, but it
% does have integrity. Also, it does recur. Or rather: the
% recurrence is in the forward count; starting over marks an
% advance, as if to mark something new rather than starting
% over. Start with
% brief indication that only the counting numbers can be
% encountered in succession; once we introduce rationals, we
% lose this property. 

% Because the present moment has neither parts nor position,
% it exists only to be immediately replaced by the next such
% moment. At end of lecture raise question as to whether the
% passing of time is any different from the counting of
% number.
% Put this below: Or to put this proposal
% another way, by allusion to an earlier point: no number
% belongs intrinsically to the present moment, true; but only
% because what belongs to this moment intrinsically is the
% unit out of which every such number is made. 

% Start with reference back to succession: we can put the
% counting numbers in order from one to the next; if unit is like a
% point, then the difference between numbers is absolute;
% but in counting by a unit, we overcome this difference.
