\maketitle

If you asked me the question ``What is the
time?'' I could look at my watch---or these days, at my
phone---and tell you. It's 8:02. But what if you changed
your question, by leaving out the definite article? Suppose
your question weren't ``What is \emph{the} time?'', but more
simply, ``What is~\dots\ time?''   

In that case, it's hard to know what my answer would be, but
easy to suppose that it could not be as immediate, or exact, or
conclusive as the time 8:02 was to your first question.
About a matter less suited to our phones than to some theory, even 
philosophy, about the nature of time.

There is no shortage of such philosophies. The Freshmen, in
fact, have just finished reading one---Aristotle's---while
the Sophomores read another---Augustine's---last semester. I
myself will be referring to Aristotle's at least twice in my
lecture tonight; but I will do so at least twice, then, with
a caveat. And the caveat has to do with the question that
will guide me in this lecture, which is not, for better or
worse, the question: ``What is time?''---at least if asking
this question means turning away, either at once or for
good, from our time-telling phones or watches or clocks, as
if our telling of time had nothing to tell us, to teach
us, about the nature of time.  My question, then, is
something lees like ``What is time?'' and something more
like: ``What is it about time that allows it to be told?''
What is it about time, in other words, that allows us to ask
about \emph{the} time---definite article reintroduced---and
to answer that question with all the immediacy, the
exactness, and the conclusiveness of ``it's 8:02''---or
rather, ``8:06.'' My working hypothesis for the next hour,
then, will be that in telling you it's 8:06, or indeed in
referring to ``the next hour'' as I just did, and more
generally in every ready-at-hand way we have of marking
time, of measuring time, of reckoning time, there is
something important to discover, even essential, about the
nature of time.  Something that accounts for time, if you
will, in our counting of time. 

But what could this be? After all, there is nothing
essential in my calling the next hour ``an hour.'' For 
I could just as well, if more oddly in this context, have
called this hour ``60 minutes.'' Or even ``3,600
seconds''---if I've done my math right; and despite
the fact that the number 3,600 is not the number 60, nor is
60 the number one---if there is such a number. Our
counting of time in this sense---the sense in which we
use numbers to mark intervals of time---seems 
conventional and
arbitrary, rather rather than rooted and essential. 

There seems to be even more convention and arbitrariness in
the counting of time that led me to say it was 8:02, or
8:06, or, now, 8:10. The counting of time, that is, where we
use numbers to mark moments rather than intervals of time.
For while it may be 8:10 in Annapolis, it is only 6:10 in
Santa Fe. I could also call it 6:10 in Flagstaff---if I were
giving this lecture before Spring Break. But tonight I have
to admit that it is only 5:10 in Flagstaff, since Flagstaff
doesn't follow Santa Fe or Annapolis in observing Daylight
Saving Time. And if I were giving this lecture before the
Uniform Time Act of 1966, I wouldn't know what to say about
the time elsewhere. For back then, cities in the United
States could choose their own dates for Daylight Saving Time
at will; and they did, in what Time Magazine called a
``chaos of clocks.'' Not the ``clocks'' we find populating
Einstein's theory of relativity, as if cities had discovered
themselves in different frames of reference with no present
moment in common; but rather the ``clocks'' we naively use
in ordinary life, where there is taken to be a present
moment in common, but no like moment in number, it seems, no
number that belongs to ``now,'' to stop us from assigning it
different numbers at once---8:15 in Annapolis, 7:15 in
Memphis, 6:15 in Santa Fe, 5:15 in Napa. Even a further
description of this ``now'' gives us no sense of a
particular number that belongs to it---the ``now'' that
begins Friday Night lecture in Annapolis, for example, is
presently 8:00, but it used to be 8:15. And in Santa Fe it
is 7:30 but used to be 8:00. Similarly with the ``now'' of
seminar: for undergraduates in Annapolis it starts at 8, but
for graduate institute students at 7:30---and 7:30 in Santa
Fe for both.  ---Except for the 4:30 seminars, one for each
class, the year I was in Santa Fe. And if we include
seminar-parties, where the start-time is assigned at will,
well---there would seem no time excluded in principle: which
is again as if to say there is no no number that belongs
intrinsically to any ``now,'' or no ``now'' in number. And if
time itself exists only ``now,'' in the present moment,
since the past is no longer and the future not yet, then it
would seem as if there is no number that belongs
intrinsically to time, or nothing temporal in number. 

But then we might have inferred as much even without
examples from convention. For if we think of time as having
any properties beyond the present moment, it is most likely
when we think of this moment as ever-changing---which is to
say, when we think of time as if it were like a stream, or
flow---continuous and ongoing. But the numbers we use to
count time are discrete, and in the most useful cases
recurring, going repeatedly back to 1 from year to year,
month to month, week to week, and day to day, even as time
itself, we know, goes inexorably forward. But this, then, is
not just another sign that there is something conventional
rather than essential in our counting of time, but that the
count in question is not really of time, but rather of
change. Brief show how change explains everything about the
previous examples. Even to the point of thinking that the
count itself is a kind of change (refer to Einstein),
leaving nothing to time.  Then use Aristotle as transition.
but even that it isn't of time that we do it.

even say that philosophical reflection. Mention Augustine
and Aristotle, along with ignorance and non-existence, about
the nature of time. As if time were something mysterious and
deep. Then proceed to a lecture keeping closer
to the connection, since there seems to be one. And that
reflection can start where we are. [Now move on to why the

Why in that case is there a seeming distance—even
gap—between the ease of answering the question "what is the
time?" and the difficulty of answering the question "what is
