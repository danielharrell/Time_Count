\maketitle

If you asked me the question ``What is the
time?'' I could look at my watch---or these days, at my
phone---and tell you. It's 8:02. But what if you changed
your question, by leaving out the definite article? Suppose
your question weren't ``What is \emph{the} time?'', but more
simply, ``What is~\dots\ time?''   

In that case, it is hard to know what my answer would be, but
easy to suppose it could not be as immediate, or exact, or
conclusive as the time 8:02 was to your first question. And
a matter less suited to our phones than to some theory, even 
philosophy, about the nature of time.

There is no shortage of such philosophies. The Freshmen, in
fact, have just finished reading one---Aristotle's---while
the Sophomores read another---Augustine's---last semester. I
myself will be referring to Aristotle's twice in my
lecture tonight; but I will do so twice with a kind of
caveat. And the caveat has to do with the question that will
guide me in this lecture, and which is not, for better or
worse, the question: ``What is time?''---at least if asking
this question means turning away, either at once or for
good, from our phones and our clocks, as if our telling of
the time had nothing to tell us, to teach us, about the
nature of time.  My question, then, is something lees like
``What is time?'' and something more like: ``What is it
about time that allows it to be told?'' What is it about
time, in other words, that allows us to ask about \emph{the}
time---definite article reintroduced---and to answer that
question with all the immediacy, the exactness, and the
conclusiveness of ``it's 8:02''---or rather, ``8:06.'' My
working hypothesis for the next hour, then, will be that in
telling you it's 8:06, or indeed in referring to ``the next
hour'' as I just did, and more generally in every
ready-at-hand way we have of marking time, of measuring
time, of reckoning time, there is something important to
discover, even essential, about the nature of time.
Something that accounts for time, if you will, in our
counting of time. 

But what could this be? After all, there is nothing
essential in my calling the next hour ``an hour''---since 
I could just as well, if perhaps less expectedly, have
called it ``60 minutes,'' or even ``3,600
seconds'' if I've done my math right; and despite
the fact that the number 3,600 is not the number 60, nor is
60 the number one---if there is such a number. Our
counting of time in this sense---the sense in which we
use numbers to mark intervals of time---thus seems 
conventional and
arbitrary, rather rather than rooted and essential. And
there seems to be even more convention and arbitrariness in
the counting of time that led me to say it was 8:02, or
8:06, or, now, 8:10. (start from here) 

even
more conventional and arbitrary would seem And our
way of counting numeration . iesOne might
even say that philosophical reflection. Mention Augustine
and Aristotle, along with ignorance and non-existence, about
the nature of time. As if time were something mysterious and
deep. Then proceed to a lecture keeping closer
to the connection, since there seems to be one. And that
reflection can start where we are. [Now move on to why the
separation.] 


Why in that case is there a seeming distance—even
gap—between the ease of answering the question "what is the
time?" and the difficulty of answering the question "what is
timee?" \end{document}
