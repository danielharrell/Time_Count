\maketitle

If you asked me the question ``What is the
time?'' I could look at my watch---or these days, at my
phone---and tell you. It's 8:02. But what if you changed
your question, by leaving out the definite article? Suppose
your question weren't ``What is \emph{the} time?'', but more
simply, ``What is~\dots\ time?''   

In that case, it's hard to know what my answer would be, but
easy to suppose that it could not be as immediate, or exact, or
conclusive as the time 8:02 was to your first question.
About a matter less suited to our phones than to some theory, even 
philosophy, about the nature of time.

There is no shortage of such philosophies. The Freshmen, in
fact, have just finished reading one---Aristotle's---while
the Sophomores read another---Augustine's---last semester. I
myself will be referring to Aristotle's at least twice in my
lecture tonight; but I will do so at least twice, then, with
a caveat. And the caveat has to do with the question that
will guide me in this lecture, which is not, for better or
worse, the question: ``What is time?''---at least if asking
this question means turning away, either at once or for
good, from our time-telling phones or watches or clocks, as
if our telling of time had nothing to tell us, to teach
us, about the nature of time.  My question, then, is
something lees like ``What is time?'' and something more
like: ``What is it about time that allows it to be told?''
What is it about time, in other words, that allows us to ask
about \emph{the} time---definite article reintroduced---and
to answer that question with all the immediacy, the
exactness, and the conclusiveness of ``it's 8:02''---or
rather, ``8:06.'' My working hypothesis for the next hour,
then, will be that in telling you it's 8:06, or indeed in
referring to ``the next hour'' as I just did, and more
generally in every ready-at-hand way we have of marking
time, of measuring time, of reckoning time, there is
something important to discover, even essential, about the
nature of time.  Something that accounts for time, if you
will, in our counting of time. 

But what could this be? After all, there is nothing
essential in my calling the next hour ``an hour.'' For 
I could just as well, if more oddly in this context, have
called this hour ``60 minutes.'' Or even ``3,600
seconds''---if I've done my math right; and despite
the fact that the number 3,600 is not the number 60, nor is
60 the number one---if there is such a number. Our
counting of time in this sense---the sense in which we
use numbers to mark intervals of time---seems 
conventional and
arbitrary, rather rather than rooted and essential. 

There seems to be even more convention and arbitrariness in
the counting of time that led me to say it was 8:02, or
8:06, or, now, 8:10. The counting of time, that is, where we
use numbers to mark moments rather than intervals of time.
For while it may be 8:10 in Annapolis, it is only 6:10 in
Santa Fe. I could also call it 6:10 in Flagstaff---if I were
giving this lecture before Spring Break. But tonight I have
to admit that it is only 5:10 in Flagstaff, since Flagstaff
doesn't follow Santa Fe or Annapolis in observing Daylight
Saving Time. And if I were giving this lecture before the
Uniform Time Act of 1966, I wouldn't know what to say about
the time elsewhere. For back then, cities in the United
States could choose their own dates for Daylight Saving Time
at will; and they did, in what Time Magazine called a ``chaos of
clocks.'' Not the ``clocks'' we find populating
Einstein's account of relativity, as if cities had 
discovered themselves in different frames of reference with
no present moment in common; but rather the ``clocks'' in
ordinary life, (mention I can call Santa fe and Annapolis a
now). where there is taken to be a present moment
in common, but seemingly no like moment in number, no
numerical ``now'', to stop us from assigning it any number we
please: where this be assigning it any such number we
please.  n

special theory of relativity, as if cities had suddenly in this case, I take it the
magazine didn't mean the chaos in this case seems to have come not
from any deep truth about time, as if cities had suddenly
discovered the special theory of relativity; but more simply
because there is nothing in the nature of a given temporal
moment that demands it be assigned a given number---or
indeed any number. Or to put it another way, there is no
``now'' in number. demands it be assigned a given number
``now'', that demands it be assigned a particular number. o

even say that philosophical reflection. Mention Augustine
and Aristotle, along with ignorance and non-existence, about
the nature of time. As if time were something mysterious and
deep. Then proceed to a lecture keeping closer
to the connection, since there seems to be one. And that
reflection can start where we are. [Now move on to why the
separation.] 


Why in that case is there a seeming distance—even
gap—between the ease of answering the question "what is the
time?" and the difficulty of answering the question "what is
timee?" \end{document}
