\maketitle

If you asked me the question ``What is the time?'' I could
look at my watch---or these days, at my phone---and tell
you. It's [current time=A]. But what if you changed
your question, by leaving out the definite article? Suppose
your question weren't ``What is \emph{the} time?'', but more
simply, ``What is~\dots\ time?''   

In that case, it's hard to know what my answer would be, but
easy to suppose that it could not be as immediate, or exact,
or conclusive as the time [A] was to your
first question.  And about a matter less suited to our
phones than to some theory, even philosophy, about the
nature of time.

The Freshmen, in fact, have just finished reading
one---Aristotle's; and my debts to it in this lecture should
be clear before I'm done. Still, the question that guides me
tonight is not ``What is time?''---at least if asking this
question means turning away, either at once or for good,
from our phones, our watches, our clocks; and as if our telling
of time had nothing to tell us---to teach us---about the
nature of time.  My question, then, is something less like
``What is time?'' and something more like: ``What is it
about time that allows it to be told?'' What is it about
time that allows us to ask about the time---definite
article reintroduced---and to answer that question with all
the immediacy, the exactness, and the conclusiveness of
``it's [time A]''---or rather, ``[current time=B].'' My
hypothesis for the next hour, then, will be that in
telling you it's [time B], or indeed in referring to ``the
next hour,'' and more generally in every ready-at-hand way
we have of marking time, of measuring time, of reckoning
time, there is something important to discover, even
essential, about the nature of time.  Something that
accounts for time, in our counting of time. 

But what could this be? After all, there is nothing
essential in my calling the next hour an ``hour.'' For I
could just as well have called this hour ``60 minutes.'' Or
even ``3,600 seconds''---if I've done my math right; and
despite the fact that the number 3,600 is not the number 60,
nor is 60 the number one---if there is such a number. Our
counting of time in this sense, the sense in which we use
numbers to mark \emph{intervals} of time, seems borrowed and
arbitrary rather than rooted or necessary---a matter of
convention rather than essence. 

And there is even more convention, it would
seem, in the counting of time that led me to say it was
[time A], or [time B], or, now, [current time=C].  This is
the count where we use numbers to mark \emph{moments} of
time rather than intervals.  For while it may be [time C] in
Annapolis on this side of King George Street, it is [time C
+ 12] on the other side---and only [time C minus two
hours=D] in Santa Fe. I could also call it [time D] in
Flagstaff---if I were giving this lecture before Spring
Break. But in giving it tonight, I will have to admit that
it is only [time D minus one hour=E] in Flagstaff, since
Arizona refuses to observe Daylight Saving Time. And if I were
giving this lecture before the Uniform Time Act of 1966, I
wouldn't know what to say about the time elsewhere. For back
then, cities in the United States could choose their own
dates for Daylight Saving Time at will; and they did, in
what Time Magazine called a ``chaos of clocks.'' And not the
clocks we find populating Einstein's theory of relativity,
as if cities had discovered themselves in different frames
of reference with no present moment in common; but rather
the clocks we more innocently use in everyday life, where
there is taken to be a present moment in common, but no like
moment in number, it seems, no number that belongs to
``now,'' to stop us from assigning it different numbers at
once---where ``now'' is [current time=F] in Annapolis, [time
F minus one hour] in Memphis, [time F minus two hours] in
Santa Fe, or [time F minus three hours] in Flagstaff.

And giving content to this present moment, still gives us no sense
of the number that might belong to it. The ``now'' that
begins Friday Night lecture in Annapolis, for example, is
officially 8:00pm, but it used to be 8:15. In Santa Fe it is
7:30, but used to be 8:00. Similarly with the ``now'' that
begins seminar: for undergraduates in Annapolis, this is 8,
but for graduate institute students 7:30---and 7:30 in Santa
Fe for both.  ---Except for the 4:30 seminars, one for each
class, at least the year I was in Santa Fe. And if we
include seminar-parties, where the start-time is assigned at
will, well---there would seem no number excluded in principle:
which is again as if to say there is no ``now'' in number;
no number that belongs intrinsically to any present
moment.  And if time itself exists only in the present
moment, since the past is no longer and the
future not yet, then there would seem to be no number that
belongs intrinsically to time. 

But then we might have inferred this much---that time is one
thing and number something else---even without such
examples. 
% Dedekind, whom the Juniors are about to read, once
% called numbers ``free creations of the human mind.'' If only
% this were true as well about the moments of time.
For if we think of time as having any existence
beyond the present moment, it is most likely when we think
of this moment as ever-new or -changing, making time 
like a river, moving always forward in a continuous flow. 
% Later say time is like a march, not river.
But our counting of time uses number to form a different kind
of succession, which is never continuous and
usually recurring: going repeatedly back to 1
from day to day, week to week, month to month, and year to
year, even as time itself rolls on---a fact soon enough
written on our faces, even if we erase it from our clocks
and calendars. 

% Perhaps later link the discreteness to the possibility of
% recurrence But there would be no way to go back to 1,
% unless our numbers were at-hand in a way that time is
% evidently not; and counting from one moment to the next,
% even as the earlier moment vanishes, didn't cause the
% earlier number to vanish.  

Our counting of time in these respects even suggests that
the count is not really of time, but rather of place, in
following motions that, unlike time, continue and finally
complete themselves with respect to place. We count to 365,
then, in following the yearly trip of the earth around the
sun; as we count to 30---or close enough---in following the
monthly trip of the moon around the earth; or to 24, in
following the daily trip of the earth around itself. And
dividing this 24 into its units, accordingly divides the
earth into 24 places---each a so-called time zone,
explaining the difference in time between Annapolis and
Santa Fe as really a difference in place.  Even our weekly
count to 7 in this sense, which otherwise has no source in
the completed motion of any celestial body, might still be
said to follow one---the very motion that, on one account at
least, created every celestial body, along with everything
else, over six days of work finished by a seventh of rest.
Nor need we look so far above us for seeming proof that our
telling of time is really of place. For we can find this
proof writ small on the face of any watch, where every
number has its place, and every time in turn, its position.
Yet if time itself has no place or position---and we might
even consider it a negation of any place or position---then
our every clock, it seems, tells a bald-faced lie.

But this is to argue against what I earlier called my
hypothesis for the next hour---now my hypothesis for the
next 45 minutes---which is that our every clock tells the
truth. And perhaps it is time---whatever that may be---to
make the case for our clocks. Consider again our sense of
time itself, when we think of it like a river. In certain
respects---decisive respects---the simile falls short. For
the motion of a river, we can see and say, is made by the
river, as it moves along its banks, now more swiftly, now
more slowly.  But in the motion of time, there is nothing
like the river or its banks to see, nothing visibly moving
relative to anything else. And no surprise, for there would
only be anything visible, it seems, if the motion of time
were a motion in space.  This motion is already peculiar,
then, in belonging to time.  And it becomes still more
peculiar when we consider its progress.  We sometimes fancy
that, again like a river moving swifter or slower, time
itself can fly or drag. But if time could really do this,
how would we know?  When anything else changes its speed,
after all, we can use some unit of time to confirm it, as a
change in the distance traveled, for example, per second.
But we are deprived of this unit to confirm any change of
speed in time itself; for it is the unit now in question: is
this second, when compared to the last, or the next, faster
or slower, longer or shorter?  And the very concept of
speed, since this involves the concept of distance, seems
ill-applied to time, even before we come to the matter of
changes in its speed. But what, then, becomes of time's
supposed motion, by any but a false analogy to any movement
in space? For in belonging to time and time alone, this
motion of necessity bears no trace of being accomplished at
any speed, by any mover, from any place to any other place.

% Next paragraph should lead to conclusion that if we are
% strip any taint of space from our conception of time in
% all its progressiveness, it becomes hard not to conceive
% it as a succession of numbers, as a count. 

The more plausible conclusion, it seems to me, is that time
doesn't move like a river, because it doesn't move at all;
if it did, then it would no longer be time, but at best,
something \emph{in} time. But to admit even this much risks
another false analogy between time and a river---in this case, a river
that doesn't move, but still provides a medium for what does
move, as it travels across any length of space, only by also
traveling through some length of time. (Again, the problem
here is spatial.)

precisely because time is time, it cannot move. But then, is
it doing, These reasons are sufficient, it seems to me, to look

attempt to conceive its existence beyond the present moment. ,

time, in units of time, as if
it could vl,

one in which nothing is seen to move Time's
motion is then peculiar:If we then
insist that time is still a motion, it remains a peculiar
motion in which there is no discernible object moving, or
any objects again in our sense
of time's like motion, Consider again First, there is
something amiss paradoxical and even incoherent in our sense
of time itself. We might again suppose it flows like a
stream, or river, but presumably without any change of
actual place or ; yet time is surely unlike a stream or
river in more decisive respects: for this is presumably
without any change in place, If we think of it as a stream,
or flow, we are thinking of it by analogy to a river; but
the analogy, when pressed, falls apart almost at once. For
one thing, the flow of a river is a motion, involving both a
change of place and a thing doing the changing. ---let us
suppose these belong to the bank, andes a change of place
along with an identifiable sourceis a motion that involves a
discernible change of place; whereas the flow of
timepresumably involv every clockthat again there something
important and even essential to discover about the nature of
time in our, even essential, about the nature of time in our
is is the best I can do to argue against what I called my
working hypothesis

And if our counting of time were really of place, it would
explain not simply the recurrence in our count, but the
discreteness in number that makes it a count. For then we
could say that each such number corresponds to a place in
the motion counted. And our clocks, so understood, would be
no different from our rulers: dividing a continuous
magnitude into so many successive but contiguous parts, in a
count from, say, 1 to 12. The count will be of inches if we
find this magnitude laid out on a ruler; but if we rather
find it rounded off, as on the face of watch, then the count
will be of hours. In both cases, however, the count from 1
to 12 will be following a change in place, not time.
The only difference, it seems, will
be one that underlines the sense in which our apparent
counting of time is really of place.  For the count from 1
to 12 on a ruler can take place at once, while the count
from 1 to 12 on a watch---well, we might have said it takes
time, but according to the account just given, we should
rather say it takes motion: in this case, the motion of an
hour-hand, inching its way around the watch's circumference,
which in turn follows the motion of the earth around its own
circumference. And so it goes if we count instead to 60 on
our watch, now following the faster motion of a minute-hand
or still-faster motion of a second-hand. All these cases
suggest that a change in place is not simply what our
apparent counting of time is really of, but even what it
really is if temporal at all: involving one motion, like the
rotation of the earth, being counted by another motion, like
the hour-hand of a watch. Perhaps time itself is yet a third
motion, encompassing the first two and any other; but it is
hard to see how this motion is Similarly,  Just our count
from 1 to 60 on a watch the count from 1 to  we can  

But this much comparison between clocks and rulers obscures
an essential difference. For the count from 1 to 12 on a
ruler takes place at once (perhaps put taking time up here
immediately, mention circularity, but then try to analyze it
out of the account to make sense of time) mention
simultaneity here).  And this is why, when we use a ruler to
count, we reach any number---say, 6 inches---by inspection
rather than calculation. since its parts, or places, exist
alongside one another, in a relation of simultaneity. And in
, the count from 1 to 12 on a watch---well, it takes time,
or at least takes place in a kind of succession that invites
us to re-consider the nature of this count.  the count is a
counting of. In a sense, we ourselves cannot count to 12 on
a watch, just like that; we have to wait for the hour-hand
to do it, as it inches its way round the circumference. The
waiting is less if we follow the minute-hand around the
circumference, and still less for the second-hand, but this
only underlines the point. In every such case, and it seems
to make for the difference between a temporal count and a
merely spatial count, the count in question follows the
change in place not directly, but through a motion. The
count itself is not what carries us from place to place, but  

Also mention that on a ruler, the places themselves are
numbered, while on a watch, it is only a motion through
those places that is numbered.
And this reflects a difference
in what we mean by \emph{counting} in either case. For in
the case of the ruler, we can redivide the magnitude into,
say, sixty parts, and our count to 60 will be equal to our
count to 12, by encompassing the same interval of length.
But on a watch-face, this same redivision of its
circumference, from 12 parts into 60, makes for unequal
counts, since they encompass different intervals of time. In
the case of a ruler, our count from 1 to 12 can be remade ,
we could say that while the count from 1 to 12 on a ruler
[Distinguish second, minute, hour hand, and 12 from 60;
different rates of speed.] Note too that the divisions of
the same magnitude also take different times. Also how this
underlines the sense in which we are indeed counting a time.
We have to wait for the .  Link to count in sense that the
different times each have a different count. 

it will be a
magnitude that we measure And this would be by analogy to the
way we measure any magnitude, which may be continuous in
itself but is divided into parts And just as the recurrence
of our countThis not only explains recurrence of our count,
but the discreteness of the numbers we use in the count.
Start this paragraph by now talking about how the the
continuity of time is in truth a continuity in the places of
the motion, and our use of numbers here is no different than
our use of them is measuring places with a ruler. [Put how
this is exactly like the measure of a ruler]

Mention how the count itself can be regarded as a motion,
and use Einstein, along with the sense in which larger
time-scales depend on the clock time-scale of each passing
hour, to support this. 
But then use the Aristotle to counter that. This part will
then conclude with the observation that we have altogether
separating our count of time from time. How to restore them?
Then go on to use the Aristotle.


Brief show how change explains everything about the previous
examples. Even to the point of thinking that the count tself
is a kind of change (refer to Einstein), leaving nothing to
time.  Then use Aristotle as transition.  but even that it
isn't of time that we do it.
