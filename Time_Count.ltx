\maketitle

If you asked me the question ``What is the
time?'', I could look at my watch---or these days, at my
phone---and tell you. It's 8:02. But what if you changed
your question, by leaving out the definite article? Suppose
your question weren't ``What is \emph{the} time?'', but more
simply, ``What is~\dots\ time?''   

In that case, it is hard to know what my answer would be, but
easy to suppose it could not be as immediate, or exact, or
conclusive as the time 8:02 was to your first question. And
a matter less suited to smartphones than to some theory,
even philosophy, about the nature of time.

And there is no shortage of such philosophies. One might
even say that philosophical reflection. Mention Augustine and Aristotle, along with ignorance and
non-existence, about the nature of time. Then proceed to a
lecture keeping closer to the connection, since there seems
to be one.[Now move on to
	why the separation.] 


Why in that case is there a seeming distance—even
gap—between the ease of answering the question "what is the
time?" and the difficulty of answering the question "what is
timee?" \end{document}
